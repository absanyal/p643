A simple program to calculate the intensity distribution of 'ns' number of
 slits. 'r' is the ratio between the distance between thye slits to the 
distance between the slits and the screen. The program has been hardcoded
 with the result of a single slit, and multiplies them with a modulation
 factor to get the result of n slits. The sample has been run with ns=2 and
 r = 0.2.
