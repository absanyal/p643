The program computes the integral of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, 1/(1+e^x) between limits provided at run time. The integral is calculated at several numbers of intervals, starting from 1000 to 10000 at increments of 500. Run using

'''bash run.sh'''

'plot.p' contains a GNUUplot script to create 'plot.pdf' which has plot of the same integrand as above.
